In this test, I test the behaviors of multi-dimension vector.

To begin with, i can use vector<vector<int>>(5), to create a 2d vector which contains 5 empty 1d vector

if i did't do this, I would meet a error: can't dereference an iterator a empty project!

i have searched on many forums but no one mentioned this prob

thx to my roomate SanJin
